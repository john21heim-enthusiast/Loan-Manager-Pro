Loan Manager Pro: User Guide
Welcome to Loan Manager Pro. This app is designed to help small lenders track loans, calculate precise interest, and generate professional vouchers directly from their mobile devices.
1. Initial Setup (Install as an App)
For the best experience on iPad or iPhone, do not use the app inside the Safari browser bars:
1. Open your GitHub Live Link in Safari.
2. Tap the Share button (square with an arrow).
3. Select "Add to Home Screen".
4. Open the app from your home screen icon for a full-screen, professional feel.
2. Recording a New Loan
1. Enter Details: Go to the Lending tab. Enter the Borrower’s Name, Start Date, Principal Amount, and Monthly Interest Rate.
2. Generate Draft: If you want to send a record immediately upon giving the money, tap Generate Lending Receipt.
3. Share: Tap Share as Image to send a clean voucher to the borrower via Viber, WhatsApp, or Messenger.
3. Calculating Repayments
When a borrower is ready to pay you back:
1. Go to the History list and find the borrower.
2. Tap Edit to pull their data into the calculator.
3. Switch to the Calculation tab.
4. Select the Repayment Date. The app will automatically calculate:
• Duration: (e.g., 2 Months & 5 Days).
• Interest: Based on your monthly rate.
• Total Due: Principal + Interest.
5. Tap Save to History to update your records.
4. Generating Final Vouchers
1. From the Calculation tab, tap View Final Voucher.
2. Review the details on the Receipt tab.
3. Tap Share as Image. This creates a high-quality photo of the voucher that you can send as "Proof of Settlement."
5. Managing Your Portfolio
• Search: Use the search bar in the History tab to find borrowers by name.
• Settling: Once a borrower has paid in full, tap the Settle button. This will grey out the entry and remove the amount from your Active Dashboard totals.
• Dashboard: Check the top of your History tab to see exactly how much money you currently have "on the street" (Total Outstanding).
Important Security Note
• Privacy: This app uses Local Storage. Your data is saved only on your specific device.
• Backups: If you clear your browser history or "Reset" your iPad, your data may be lost. It is recommended to take screenshots of your history list once a week for safety.
